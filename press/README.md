## History

_Five-in-One_ is part of my ongoing idea of essentially spending 2019 making variations on the base _Ancient Greek Punishment_ set of minigames as a way to remain "productive" while in transition to a life with a new baby. In fact, I've ended up making a few other games this year as well, but the punishment series has been my chief focus.

In this case, I wanted to explore the extremely simple concept of making all the games playable simultaneously. I've been interested in this sort of "multi-input" experience for a while, but hadn't had a vehicle to explore it with previously - the punishment games make a nice foil. As such, it's a pretty uninteresting technical project - it just slaps all five scenes into one and uses transparency to make every sprite visible at the same time. The actual experience of playing, though, is quite interesting I think, there's a since of the collected punishments forming a kind of "machine" that you're driving forward with your input. The movements of the characters seem like pistons performing endless work. As such, I feel like this particular game fits well with my instinct that it's important to actually _make_ these sorts of conceptual games rather than just to hypothesise them and assume you know what the meaning or outcome would be. I think the experience of this game is more than just the core concept of "all at once", there's a gestalt effect I'm glad I didn't miss.

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Five-in-One_ is also another reference point in the ultra-detailed process documentation approach called [MDMA](http://www.gamesasresearch.com/mdma). In this case, because the game is so simple, there's less documentation that I usually produce. Nonetheless, you can read a little about the game's development by reading its [process documentation](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-five-in-one/blob/master/process/README.md) or by going through its [commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/lets-play-ancient-greek-punishment-five-in-one/commits/master).
